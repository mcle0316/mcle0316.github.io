     <h2>About Me</h2>      
     <p> Why do I design? I design because I am a visual person. I think in pictures, colours, and shapes more than I
    can think in words. It is the way I express myself. I find it very hard to form full thoughts from my head into
    sentences on a piece of paper. However when it comes to design it comes more naturally. Designing is my
    passion. It is something that I like to do all the time. Theres always a new challenge, a problem to solve. And
    although I am terrible at math problems, I am good at solving design problems. Itâ€™s more than just being a
    design.</p>

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
